🌸 Iris Flower Classification
📌 Overview
The Iris Flower Classification project is a beginner-friendly machine learning taskthat involves predicting the species of an iris flower based on its petal and sepal dimensions.
This dataset is one of the most well-known and widely used in data science for classification problems. 
This project was completed as part of a Data Science Internship at OasisInfobyte.

📊 Problem Statement
The goal is to classify iris flowers into one of three species:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

based on four features:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

🧠 Approach
Data Collection
Used the popular Iris dataset available through sklearn.datasets.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized data using scatter plots and histograms

Checked class distribution

Analyzed feature correlations

Preprocessing

Checked for missing values

Normalized data if needed

Model Selection

Trained and tested different machine learning algorithms such as:

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Decision Tree

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Evaluation

Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix

Result
Achieved high accuracy (>95%) on the test data with multiple models.
